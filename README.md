# ParkHive - Smart Parking System Simulation

## Overview

ParkHive is a Smart Parking System Simulation built with Python using tkinter for the GUI. The system simulates a smart parking environment where parking slots can be reserved, modified, and managed dynamically. The program randomly occupies and vacates parking slots, allowing users to interact with them through a graphical interface.

### Key Features:
- *Slot Reservation*: Reserve a parking slot for a specific duration.
- *Slot Occupancy Simulation*: Simulates random occupancy of parking slots and automatically vacates them after a specific time.
- *Slot Status*: Displays the current status of each parking slot (Vacant, Occupied, Reserved).
- *Time Calculation*: Calculates and displays the time a car has been parked in a particular slot.
- *Dynamic Updates*: The system continuously updates the parking slot statuses, and users can interact with the interface to make changes.

## Features

- *Random Slot Occupancy*: Randomly assign a luxury car to a vacant parking slot.
- *Slot Reservation*: Users can reserve a parking slot for a certain number of minutes.
- *Car Removal*: Automatically removes cars from parking slots after a set time.
- *Slot Interaction*: Modify the parking duration for occupied slots and manage reserved slots.
- *Display Updates*: Continuously updates the status of all slots in real time.
- *Vacant Slot Listing*: Shows a list of currently vacant slots.
- *Shortest Time Occupied Slots*: Displays the slots with the shortest parking duration.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone or download the repository:
